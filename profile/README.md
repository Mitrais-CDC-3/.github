ServSkills is a Web app that provides services for all our needs. Starting from Beauty & Wellness, Travel & Food, Home maintenance, People & Pet care to Teaching & Tutoring. Users could quickly search and book for services. Additionally, choosing a city's specifics makes it simpler for users to receive prompt service. By examining past customer rates, users can more easily narrow down their search for the best services. Furthermore, sellers can easily sell on our site. Sellers just need to sign up by completing the form on the "become a seller" page, then they can wait for the admin to respond. The merchant then posted the service on ServSkills after registering it.
